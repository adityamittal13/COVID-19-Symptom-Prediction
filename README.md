Make sure to update all files and datasets regularly as they update almost every day;
As of 7/16 - the "ppe" dataset is not on github (due to its large file size) and the Kaggle dataset is not on github - however the link is here (https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge)
